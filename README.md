## NYC Taxi Fare & Tipping Prediction

### Business Problem
The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) aims to improve fare transparency
and driver revenue using predictive analytics.

### Objectives
- Predict taxi ride fare before the trip
- Analyze factors influencing fare amount
- Evaluate tipping behavior ethically

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy)
- Tableau / Matplotlib
- Statistical testing (t-test)
- Regression & Machine Learning models

### Project Workflow
1. Preliminary data inspection & variable selection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis & outlier handling
3. Statistical A/B testing
4. Multiple Linear Regression modeling
5. Machine Learning models & ethical review

### Key Results
- Regression model achieved R² of 0.87
- Credit card payments correlated with higher fares
- ML tipping model showed limited predictive power (F1 ≈ 0.35)

### Business Impact
- Enables fare estimation before ride start
- Supports data-driven payment policy decisions
- Highlights ethical considerations in predictive modeling
